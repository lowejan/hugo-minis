# HUGO MINIS

## _Keep it simple, and stupid._

**Minis** is a Hugo theme written by [Wejan](https://lujok.com), it's modified from Yihui's [XMin](https://github.com/yihui/hugo-xmin/) theme, most of `contents` and `styles` are from xmin. The main motivation for writing this theme was to provide a simple and minimal theme for myself.

## Demo

Here's a demo site: [Hugo-minis](https://minis.lujok.com).
