# HUGO MINIS

## _Keep it simple, and stupid._

**Minis** is a Hugo theme written by [Wejan](https://wejan.cn), it's modified from Yihui's [XMin](https://github.com/yihui/hugo-xmin/) theme, most of `contents` and `styles` are from xmin. The main motivation for writing this theme was to provide a simple and minimal theme for myself. Here is my website as a [demo](https://wejan.cn)(Chinese).
