title: HUGO MINIS
---

## _Keep it simple, and stupid._

**Minis** is a Hugo theme written by [Wejan](https://lujok.com), it's modified from Yihui's [XMin](https://github.com/yihui/hugo-xmin/) theme, most of `contents` and `styles` are from xmin. The main motivation for writing this theme was to provide a simple and minimal theme for myself. Here is a website as a [demo](https://minis.lujok.com).

Like [XMin](https://github.com/yihui/hugo-xmin/), it is a minimal, simple and fully functional theme. It supports pages (including the home page), blog posts, a navigation menu, categories, tags, and RSS.

All pages not under the root directory of the website are listed below. You can also visit the list page of a single section, e.g., [posts](/post/). See the [About](/about/) page for the usage of this theme.
